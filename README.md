The animations bring to life Camille's portfolio by presenting her work through a series of dynamic and visually engaging animated cards. As a tribute to the creativity and innovation of Camille's original website, this project aims to deliver a similar aesthetic experience by replicating and showcasing the captivating animations in a reimagined form.
